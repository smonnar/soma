# ADR 0001 â€” Drive Model as Leaky Integrators

## Decision
Represent internal drives (Curiosity, Stability, Pattern Completion, Truth-Seeking, Caregiver Alignment, Overload Regulation) as leaky integrators with simple coupling. Dominant drive each tick is the argmax over current levels.

## Status
Accepted (v1).

## Context
We need transparent dynamics that are easy to inspect, log, and scaffold. Gradient-based or black-box policies would reduce interpretability.

## Consequences
- Pros: simple, debuggable, and supports clear self-notes; easy to script scenarios.
- Cons: limited expressivity; no learning in the drive dynamics themselves.
- Mitigations: later phases can refine couplings or add learned components without breaking logs.
