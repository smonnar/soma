# Code of Conduct

This project follows the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct, version 2.1.

## Our Pledge
We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

## Our Standards
Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment include:
- Demonstrating empathy and kindness toward other people
- Being respectful of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- Giving and gracefully accepting constructive feedback
- Focusing on what is best for the community
- Showing gratitude and humility

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:
- Harassment, trolling, or insulting/derogatory comments
- Public or private harassment or doxxing
- Publishing others’ private information without explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate

## Enforcement Responsibilities
Project maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

## Scope
This Code applies within all project spaces and when an individual is representing the project or its community in public spaces.

## Enforcement
Report violations to the maintainers. **Contact:** _replace with a private email or contact method you control_. For sensitive matters, avoid opening a public issue; use the private contact.

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly. The maintainers are obligated to respect the privacy and security of reporters.

## Enforcement Guidelines
Community leaders will follow these guidelines to determine the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code:

1. **Correction** — Private, written warning; education around the standards.  
2. **Warning** — A warning with consequences for continued behavior.  
3. **Temporary Ban** — Temporary exclusion from interaction within community spaces.  
4. **Permanent Ban** — Permanent exclusion from community spaces.

## Attribution
This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/version/2/1/code_of_conduct/), v2.1, and the enforcement ladder inspired by Mozilla’s code of conduct.
